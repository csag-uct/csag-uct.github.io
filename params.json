We have an eclectic mix of specialties, but most importantly we put the needs of developing nation users at the forefront of everything we do. As a result, CSAG seeks to apply our core research to meet the knowledge needs of responding to climate variability and change.\r\n\r\n### CSAG source code ###\r\n\r\nThis GitHub site is a place to collect all the useful code/scripts/etc. that we use on a day to day basis as we work with various forms of climate related data.  We are making this public because we have often spent time trying to find ways of doing things and after doing it ourselves would like to make our learning available to anyone else who needs it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
